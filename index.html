There was a psychic who was popular in the 1980s named Robert Golf. What we know for sure is that the CIA has been interested in experimenting with psychics and psychic powers, and supposedly, Robert Golf and a small group of psychics were a part of the CIA’s experimentation with such powers. The conspiracy states that Golf and the other psychics were placed in bathtubs, connected to TVs, and given multiple psychedelic drugs (such as DMT), while Electroencephalogram (EEG)s were placed on their heads. The psychics would then astrally project in this setup, which allegedly would cause what they saw in their projection to be shown on the TVs. This is what is known as the “Glass Camera”.
Many risks are associated with astral projection, including derealization and, in some cases, death. The conspiracy states that during an expirament known as REMOVE VIEWING (RV) SESSION CC52, in which the psychics were to study a picture of Malcolm Kalp and try to find him via astrally projecting. Kalp was a CIA officer who was repeatedly beaten and was kept in solitary confinement for most of the 444 days he was held by militants in Tehran during the Iran hostage crisis from November 1979 - January 1981. Details of RV SESSION CC52 was released in a document the CIA released in 2000 known as the “Grill Flame Project”, which includes references to additional experiments known as RV SESSION CC51, CC53, and CC54.
The psychic in CC52 is not identified, but is not believed to be Golf. According to the conspiracy, Golf actually died while performing an extended astral projection. With the EEG still connected to his head, he supposedly captured brief footage of Heaven, before his psychic recordings were shut off.
From there people speculate that the footage was taken by the Catholic church and hidden in the Vatican Library, but this is nothing more than guesswork. All we know for sure is that, for some reason, mentions of Robert Golf have been largely scrubbed from the internet, except for a few YouTube videos and the “Grill Flame Project” CIA document.
